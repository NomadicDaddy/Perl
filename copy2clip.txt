copy2clip v1.1.1.1
Copyright ï¿½ 1999-2005 adminware, llc

Introduction
============

copy2clip allows you to quickly copy the contents of a file to your clipboard
without having to open the file, selecting everything and hitting Control-C.

Yes, I'm THAT lazy.  :)

I've added a right-click menu option to my file browser that allows me to do
this from that as well as command line.  Very handy!
